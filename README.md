Hello! If you are reading this, I am writing my thesis and I haven't found the time to add proper installation options for this software. Sorry about that! Inline comments are fairly extensive, as are the unit tests. If you have questions about this software, I can be reached at (leoneht0 at gmail dot com)

Aquinas (A QUantum INterferometer ASsembler) is a software package for transpiling linear interferometers into quantum circuits.
